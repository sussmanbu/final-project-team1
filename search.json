    "text": "Data Source\nOur primary data set comes from data.boston.gov and contains data regarding shootings in the Boston area. Data was collected by the Boston Regional Intelligence Center under the Boston Police Department Bureau of Intelligence and Analysis. This data includes both fatal and non-fatal shootings (shooting_type_v2), if a victim was struck by a bullet within the City of Boston that falls under the jurisdiction of the Boston Police Department (district). The data does not include shootings that were deemed justifiable or self-inflicted gunshot wounds. The data is from 2015 forward.\n\n\nPurpose of the Data\nThe dataset serves as a benchmark for the Boston Police Department to analyze safety and violence in Boston districts and to assess the allocation of their focus and resources. It was collected with the aim of monitoring and responding to shooting incidents within the city. Furthermore, the dataset aids in community safety initiatives and informs public policy regarding crime prevention and law enforcement effectiveness in Boston.\n\n\nDataset Overview\nThe dataset consists of 1925 rows and 8 columns, detailing both fatal and non-fatal shooting incidents. Here’s a breakdown of the unchanged variables from the original data set:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nincident_num\ninteger\nUnique identifier for each shooting incident.\n\n\nshooting_date\ndate\nDate when the shooting occurred.\n\n\ndistrict\nstring\nPolice district where the incident was reported\n\n\nshooting_type_v2\nstring\nSpecifies if the shooting was fatal or non-fatal.\n\n\nvictim_gender\nstring\nGender of the victim involved.\n\n\nvictim_race\nstring\nRace of the victim.\n\n\nvictim_ethnicity_NIBRS\nstring\nEthnicity of the victim according to NIBRS standards.\n\n\nmulti_victim\nboolean\nIndicates if multiple victims were involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning and Processing\nThe data cleaning and initial processing are documented in our R script, load_and_clean_data.R. Key steps included:\n\nRemoving entries with unknown or missing critical information to ensure data quality.\nReformatting the victim_ethnicity_NIBRS into a boolean v_hispanic_or_latinx column for clearer demographic analysis.\nSimplifying the shooting_type_v2 into a boolean fatal column to distinctly categorize incidents.\nStandardizing district names through a mapping dictionary to align with geographical descriptors used in public records.\n\n\n\nIntegration of Additional Data Sources\nWe used the tidycensus package to add census data from the American Community Survey to our original data set. We are considering key indicators such as employment status, unemployment rate, median income, percent of single-parent households, and percentage of homes that are owner occupied. We have also pulled demographic data and geolocation data to help analyze the distribution of incidents across races between Boston districts. The data tables will be merged based on each year of our initial shooting data set.\nHere is a slightly simplified version of the code we used to combine the tidycensus data with our original data set.

    "text": "Introduction\nUrban violence remains a pervasive challenge that affects cities worldwide. In Boston, variations in violent crime rates across different neighborhoods suggest a complex interplay of socioeconomic factors. This study aims to dissect the relationship between socioeconomic status—measured through variables such as income, employment, and education—and the frequency of gun violence within Boston’s diverse districts. By exploring these relationships, the study seeks to identify potential mechanisms for policy action that could mitigate violence and enhance urban safety.\nOur analysis revolves around several pivotal questions: Does higher income correlate with lower incidences of gun violence? What role does employment stability play in mitigating urban violence? How does educational attainment influence these dynamics? We hypothesized that higher socioeconomic status, indicated by increased income levels, stable employment, and higher educational attainment, is associated with reduced instances of gun violence. To test these hypotheses, we employ statistical models, including linear and logistic regressions, to examine these relationships, focusing on extracting meaningful patterns from a decade of data. This approach allows us to assess the strength and significance of these socioeconomic factors in relation to urban violence, providing a data-driven basis for recommendations and policy considerations."

    "text": "Limitations\nThe analysis conducted in this study faces several potential issues related to the data that could impact the validity and reliability of the findings. Among these is the inconsistency in reporting across different districts, which may arise from variations in how incidents are classified or documented by different officers, leading to differences in data quality. Moreover, the dataset excludes justifiable and self-inflicted shootings, potentially skewing the comprehensive understanding of the city’s gun violence.\nAdditional challenges include potential biases in how incidents are reported. Systemic biases within law enforcement practices could influence reporting rates. For example, certain neighborhoods may experience underreporting due to strained community-police relations or resource constraints. Furthermore, differing enforcement practices could lead to an overrepresentation of certain demographics as victims, introducing biases that may distort the perceived demographic patterns of gun violence.\nThese factors call for a cautious interpretation of the study’s results and point to the need for further research. Incorporating variables such as police presence, public health initiatives, and community programs, could provide a fuller picture of the factors influencing urban violence. Moreover, while this study identifies correlations between socioeconomic status and gun violence, establishing causation requires additional longitudinal and experimental research to explore the underlying mechanisms more definitively."

The original collection of this data might have been driven by law enforcement or public safety organizations aiming to monitor and respond to shooting incidents within the city. The inclusion of details like shooting type, victim demographics, and whether an incident involved multiple victims suggests an intent to understand patterns in gun violence, the demographic distribution of victims, and potentially identify areas or populations at higher risk. Loading and cleaning the data is possible, and initial steps could involve identifying any missing values. The main questions this dataset could address might revolve around identifying trends in shootings over time, assessing the distribution of shootings across different districts, understanding the demographic profile of victims, and analyzing the relationship between the type of shooting incidents and victim demographics. Challenges in analyzing this dataset might include dealing with missing or incomplete data.\nDataset 2 - Tobacco Use\nLink: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/behavioral-risk-factor-data-tobacco-use-2011-to-present\nThis data set is from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This data comes from the summation of several Tobacco surveys from 2011 to 2019. It contains 15 columns after cleaning and 43341 rows detailing location, year, race, type of tobacco consumption, gender, race, age, education, and more. This data could help us understand what demographics and locations have worse tobacco use habits, and how different age groups as well as levels of education may have different trends in tobacco use. Problems may arise from using this data set if different categories have different amounts of data, it may be harder to compare trends between categories.\nDataset 3 - School Attendance\nLink : https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-attendance-by-student-group-and-district-2021-2022\nThis dataset analyzes public school attendance from Pre-K to twelfth grade. This range will provide us with information on how students’ backgrounds like race or income level affects whether a student attends school regularly. There are 2020 observation rows. Furthermore, because the data is separated based on district, it will be clearer on how attendance might change based on demographics. Furthermore, the dataset analyzes attendance rate as a proportion to total student count on three date ranges - 2019 to 2020; 2020 to 2021; and 2021-2022. Finally, because each school district’s attendance rate is further separated by different “categories,” like race or whether or not they qualify for “Free/Reduced Lunch,” it will be useful to analyze how different hardships that students face may correlate with attendance rate. A challenge with using this dataset might be deciding which categories to use and how we can use the categories to emphasize the most meaningful results."

To obtain variables that we think will have significant interactions with the outcome variable, we have decided to utilize the tidy census package to query data from the American Community Survey through Census.gov tables. Specifically, we are considering key indicators such as employment status, percentage of those above the poverty level, unemployment rate, median income, percent of single-parent households, high school graduate population, and percentage of homes that are owner occupied. To introduce spatial analysis, we have pulled demographic and geolocation data for each of the years to analyze the distribution of incidents across race in key Boston districts based on zip codes. The names of each variable and their primary key in the database are listed below. \nAfter querying the relevant data, the next steps our team will take will involve merging the tables for each year with our initial data set. We plan on joining these tables based on year and zip code keys. Given that we are covering spatial data, we would like to model statistics such as diversity gradient and dissimilarity index across the different regions where incidents take place. We will also be producing map plots to demonstrate the difference in our dependent variable across the different regions of coverage. Additionally, the data is distributed over time, so our team will be able to analyze the temporal variance of incidents with a time series analysis. \nLink to R script with query code: https://github.com/sussmanbu/final-project-team1/blob/d0bbc5e22b53cb188ed9c0fa22820c64e190a2b6/tidycensus.R\nRace variables:  White alone, Black alone, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Asian alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone\nVariable IDs:\n‘DP03_0009’  unemployment rate\n‘B19013_001’ median income \nB11005_003E single parent households\n‘B16004_005E’ percent of individuals who do no speak english at all \n‘B16004_004E’ percent of individuals who do not speak english well \n‘B15003_017E’ high school graduate population \n‘C24010_’  Occupation by industry \n‘B23025_001E’ Employment status \n‘B17001_002E’  percent of individuals below poverty level \n‘B17001_003E’ percent above poverty level \n‘DP04_0046PE’  percent of homes that are owner occupied"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Blog Post 3: Data Cleaning\nWe first used View() to get a preliminary view of the data. We found that some of the column names and values were overly complicated and could be simplified and recategorized. For example, the column “victim_ethnicity_NIBRS” contained the values “Hispanic or Latinx” and “Not Hispanic or Latinx”. This was simplified into a “v_hispanic”or_latinx” column and the values were replaced with Booleans. The “shooting_type_v2” column (values: “fatal”, “not fatal”) were reformatted into the “fatal” column and Boolean values as well.\nThe “district” column that came with the dataset only used district codes (“A7” for East Boston, “B2” for Roxbury, etc.). A list of Boston Districts and their respective codes was created with information from: https://police.boston.gov/districts/. This information was then used to create a new column “district_name” that contains the string name of the district where the shooting occurred. It is worth noting that on the website listed, A1 and A15 are listed as “A1 & A15”, “Downtown & Charlestown”; However, due to various other sources listing Downtown and Charlestown as separate districts, we separated them and mapped “A1” to “Downtown” and “A15” to “Charlestown”. Boston Police Department consistently refers to “A1” and “A15” together however, so we may remerge them in our dataset later.\nWe searched for duplicate columns and initially thought we had found them as multiple rows contained the same “incident_num”. However, upon further analysis, we found that shootings with multiple victims were split into multiple rows, as each row would correspond to each individual victim. Therefore, it would be incorrect to remove duplicates based on incident numbers. This conclusion is corroborated by the “multi_victim” column, which is true for rows in which the incident number is shared with other rows.\nIn the initial data set, date and time were combined in one column and they were both string values. To clean this column, we split the date and time into separate columns and modified the data types using the as.Date function and changed the time to match the format “%H:%M:%S” . Since the initial data set lacked demographic information for each district, we downloaded 2020 census data for each district and merged the data into our final cleaned data set. The demographic data columns of interest are household size, College/University student housing, Institutionalized population, Black, White, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, and Other. The demographic data set did not include the district of Charlestown & Downtown resulting in a loss of 30 rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData for Equity\nBeneficence requires maximizing benefits while minimizing harm. Applying this principle to the data involves critically evaluating the risks and benefits of collecting, analyzing, and sharing information about shootings. For example, it entails carefully considering how the data could be used to improve public safety and community well-being without reinforcing negative stereotypes about certain communities. To adhere to this principle, data should be aggregated or anonymized while protecting individuals’ identities, while still providing valuable insights for public safety efforts. Transparency is also crucial in maintaining the trust of the community from which the data was collected. It involves being clear about the collection methods, the purpose of the data, and how it will be used. Transparency also requires acknowledging the limitations of the analysis, such as potential biases in data collection (over or under reporting in certain areas) and the interpretations made from the data. Limitations in the analysis could include potential biases in how incidents are reported or recorded, leading to an incomplete or skewed understanding of crime patterns. Additionally, the data could also be misused to unfairly target specific communities."

This may help emphasize which factors - median income, family structure, education levels, and homeownership rates - influence the occurrence of shooting incidents the most. We may want to emphasize the earlier years (such as 2015 - 2020), as doing so may help provide insights on how such patterns evolved, as well as helping us predict where future shootings may occur. We may also observe how factors such as population (density) affects how often there is a shooting in a particular area, as there may be more instances of shootings in areas with more people of a lower socioeconomic background. The variable of interest, income per capita, helps predict future patterns.\nDepending on the frequencies, plotly() may be useful in determining the relative frequencies of shootings based on data [Using this graph will specifically help visualize which Boston districts experience the most and least number of shootings depending ] Furthermore, packages of interest to make these plots may include ‘dplyr’. We are working on developing maps to display the distribution of demographic data over the districts for which we collected data. Following the tidycensus online text, we will plot maps for our statistically significant independent variables and incorporate our demographic data with the segregation package to map the local segregation index.\nWe are developing four models, OLS with observations for each year in our dataset, logistic regression to analyze the victim gender in each incident, a geographical weighted regression to consider the effects of neighboring locations, and an ADL time series regression to forecast incidents in 2025. Additionally, we will include scatterplots to display the interactions between statistically significant independent variables against our outcome variable."

Using these two graphs will help emphasize where Boston shootings most occur, and who is most at-risk in getting involved. Predictor variables we may be interested in are the district numbers and gender; these two variables are interesting to see where the greatest number of crimes occur - to observe possible patterns and for forecasting.\nOur analysis so far has highlighted gender differences and the frequency of incidents by district without exploring how these factors may interact with others. We could further explore temporal patterns to shed light on when incidents are more likely to occur. We could also focus on outcomes, particularly the distinction between fatal and non-fatal incidents, to help us understand the factors that contribute to the severity of shootings.\nBased on our dataset, there are two potential directions we can take for the choice of the response variable. We could predict the severity of incidents (whether it was fatal) or predict the frequency of incidents based on various factors (time, location, demographic information). To predict incident frequency, we would need to aggregate the data to have counts per day, district, or another relevant grouping. Possible predictor variables could include date/time for temporal trends, district name/district for geographical influences, victim race/gender for demographic factors of victims, or socioeconomic factors like income. If our response variable is the severity of incidents, logistic regression is the most appropriate for predicting the possibility of an incident being fatal based on the predictors. Linear regression could be used if our response variable is the number of incidents to fit a continuous distribution."

This data includes both fatal and non-fatal shootings (shooting_type_v2), if a victim was struck by a bullet within the City of Boston that falls under the jurisdiction of the Boston Police Department (district). The data does not include shootings that were deemed justifiable or self-inflicted gunshot wounds. The dataset serves as a benchmark for BPD to analyze safety and violence in Boston districts and to assess the allocation of their focus and resources. It is likely collected with the aim of monitoring and responding to shooting incidents within the city. The data is from 2015 forward.\nPotential issues with this data could include inconsistencies in reporting across districts, missing or incomplete data, variation in how incidents are classified, and potential biases in reporting (underreporting in certain neighborhoods). Bias might also exist due to overrepresentation of certain demographics as victims or systemic biases within law enforcement practices.\nThis data could be used for various purposes including trend analysis over time, understanding spatial distribution across districts, examining victim demographics, and exploring relationships between shooting incidents and victim characteristics. There may have been prior research utilizing this data to understand patterns of gun violence in Boston or to inform policy decisions related to public safety. The data might inform policy decisions related to allocation of resources for crime prevention, community outreach efforts, or gun control measures. Questions from policymakers might include inquiries about trends in shootings, effectiveness of intervention programs, or factors contributing to high-risk areas."

    "text": "Our thesis is as follows: Shooting Frequency is negatively correlated with Income Per Capita. As IPC increases, Shooting Frequency decreases. We have initial graphs that support this thesis. We decided to use Income Per Capita rather than median income to normalize our values to account for differing population sizes. We are in the process of exploring the relationships between Shooting Frequency and Employment Status as well as Education. Our initial assumptions are that low employment is correlated with more shootings, and that low education (defined as having a high school diploma) is correlated with more shootings. In terms of additional exploration, we are in the process of generating graphs to either verify or refute our previous claims. We aim to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic factors and the rate of shooting incidents in the Boston area over a ten-year period from 2015 to 2024. Our goal is to understand how variables such as employment status, poverty levels, unemployment rates, median income, family structure, education levels, and homeownership rates influence the occurrence of shooting incidents across different neighborhoods. We predict that certain factors such as high unemployment rates and elevated poverty levels will correlate with increased shooting incidents in the Boston area from 2015 to 2024. Tables we might look into include using tidycensus to get visual representations of where the most police shootings occur. This will help verify whether our hypothesis of shooting frequency and location is consistent."

    "text": "In Boston, an unsettling pattern emerges—gun violence casts a long shadow across its diverse neighborhoods. But what factors contribute to this grave issue? Our extensive study of shooting incidents over the last decade aims to determine if socioeconomic factors are at the heart of this issue. Could understanding these elements lead to a solution for the violence?\nAt the center of our study is a hypothesis: improving socioeconomic conditions—specifically income, employment, education, and racial equity—can significantly reduce the prevalence of shootings across Boston’s neighborhoods. By examining data from various neighborhoods, we explore how income, employment, education and race relate to the frequency of shootings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of gun violence across Boston reveals significant disparities that echo through its neighborhoods. The bar chart above showcases the total number of shooting incidents by district, highlighting a varied landscape of safety across the city. Notably, districts like Mattapan, Roxbury and Dorchester experience far higher frequencies of violence compared to quieter areas like the East Boston and Brighton. This visualization not only illustrates these differences but sets the stage for a deeper exploration of underlying causes. What can these variations tell us about the resources and challenges faced by residents of different districts?\n\n\n\nThe data indicates significant racial disparities in shooting incidents. Across all years and districts, the races with the highest number of shooting incidents are Black and African American, as well as Hispanic or Latinx. This is the case for both Fatal and Non-Fatal shootings.\n\nThe following graphs display the number of Fatal and Non-Fatal shootings by race every year. Although the number of incidents fluctuates a bit for each race every year, the relative number of incidents for each race compared to the others stays around the same. White, Asian, and “Unknown” consistently have an extremely low number of victims. It is worth noting that there do not appear to be any recorded Asian fatalities. It is also worth noting that for Black and African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and Unknown, an intriguing pattern emerged in 2020, with a notable spike in non-fatal shootings among these groups, followed by a decrease in 2024—a year still in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we dive deeper into the socioeconomic layers of Boston, our analysis shifts to one of the most telling indicators of community safety: economic stability. In this section, we examine how the average median income across Boston’s neighborhoods correlates with the number of shooting incidents they experience. The upcoming graph will visually showcase this relationship, revealing how economic conditions might directly influence the safety and well-being of residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, neighborhoods like South Boston and the Jamaica Plain, which hold the highest income levels, also exhibit some of the lowest rates of gun violence, contrasting sharply with areas like Mattapan and Roxbury. These findings suggest that improving economic conditions in lower-income districts could be a key strategy in reducing violence.\n\n\n\nTurning our focus to employment, we examine another vital socioeconomic indicator that may significantly influence urban safety: unemployment rates across Boston’s districts. The following graph presents the correlation between average unemployment rates and the total number of shooting incidents, offering insights into how joblessness might increase the risks of violence. The data suggests a substantial link between higher unemployment and increased shooting incidents, hinting that employment stability could be a pivotal factor in enhancing community safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph depicts a clear trend where districts with higher unemployment rates, such as Mattapan and Roxbury, also report a greater number of shooting incidents. This visualization highlights the potential role of economic distress, manifesting as unemployment, in contributing to social instability and violence. Particularly striking is the high unemployment and corresponding number of cases in Roxbury, underscoring the urgency for targeted economic and employment support in such areas. On the other hand, districts like South and East Boston, which feature relatively lower unemployment rates, witness fewer shootings, supporting our theory that job creation and economic vitality might serve as effective deterrents to violence.\n\n\n\nEducation shines through as a potential beacon of hope. The graph below illustrates the percentage of the population with bachelor’s degrees by district alongside the total number of shooting cases. It is evident that districts like Brighton and South Boston, which boast higher percentages of degree holders, report significantly fewer shootings compared to areas like Mattapan and Dorchester, where fewer residents have completed higher education. This trend is visually represented and suggests that enhancing educational opportunities could serve as a preventive measure against urban violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur comprehensive analysis paints a clear picture: socioeconomic factors are deeply intertwined with the safety of Boston’s neighborhoods. By addressing the economic, employment, and educational disparities, Boston can move toward a future where all residents have the opportunity to live in safety and prosperity. This study not only sheds light on the complexities of urban violence but also offers a blueprint for meaningful change. It is a call to action for policymakers, community leaders, and residents to unite in transforming Boston into a safer, more equitable city for all."
