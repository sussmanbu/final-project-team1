This comes from the file `data.qmd`.

  Our primary data set comes from [data.boston.gov](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/shootings/resource/73c7e069-701f-4910-986d-b950f46c91a1?inner_span=True) and contains data regarding shootings in the Boston area. Data was collected by the Boston Regional Intelligence Center under the Boston Police Department Bureau of Intelligence and Analysis. This data includes both fatal and non-fatal shootings (shooting_type_v2), if a victim was struck by a bullet within the City of Boston that falls under the jurisdiction of the Boston Police Department (district). The data does not include shootings that were deemed justifiable or self-inflicted gunshot wounds. The dataset serves as a benchmark for BPD to analyze safety and violence in Boston districts and to assess the allocation of their focus and resources. It was collected with the aim of monitoring and responding to shooting incidents within the city. The data is from 2015 forward.
	The data set is comprised of 1925 rows and 8 columns, labeled “incident_num”, “shooting_date”, “district”, “shooting_type_v2”, “victim_gender”, “victim_race”, “victim_ethnicity_NIBRS”, and “multi_victim”. 

[load_and_clean_data.R](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) has our cleaned data set.

We used the tidycensus package to add census data from the American Community Survey to our original data set. We are considering key indicators such as employment status, percentage of those above the poverty level, unemployment rate, median income, percent of single-parent households, high school graduate population, and percentage of homes that are owner occupied. We have also pulled demographic data and geolocation data to help analyze the distribution of incidents across races between Boston districts. The data tables will be merged based on each year of our initial shooting data set.

## What makes a good data set?

-   Data you are interested in and care about.
-   Data where there are a lot of potential questions that you can explore.
-   A data set that isn't completely cleaned already.
-   Multiple sources for data that you can combine.
-   Some type of time and/or location component.

## Where to keep data?

Below 50mb: In `dataset` folder

Above 50mb: In `dataset_ignore` folder.
This folder will be ignored by `git` so you'll have to manually sync these files across your team.

### Sharing your data

For small datasets (\<50mb), you can use the `dataset` folder that is tracked by github.
Add the files just like you would any other file.

If you create a folder named `data` this will cause problems.

For larger datasets, you'll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named `dataset-ignore`.
This will be ignored by git (based off the `.gitignore` file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github's size limits.
Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in `dataset-ignore` are synced across team members.

Your [load_and_clean_data.R](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) file is how you will load and clean your data.
Here is a an example of a very simple one.

source( "scripts/load_and_clean_data.R", echo = TRUE \# Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output\
)

You should never use absolute paths (eg. `/Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/` or `C:\MA415\\Final_Project\`).

You might consider using the `here` function from the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html) to avoid path problems.

### Load and clean data script

The idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them.
This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis.
Note that you don't need to run this script from every post/page.
Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or `.RData` files.
In your data page you'll describe how these results were created.
If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes.
To link to this file, you can use `[cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)` wich appears as [cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R).

## Rubric: On this page

You will

-   Describe where/how to find data.
    -   You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
    -   Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
-   Describe the different data files used and what each variable means.
    -   If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
-   Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
    -   You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
    -   Rrename variables and recode factors to make data more clear.
    -   Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
    -   Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
    -   Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
-   Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained.
