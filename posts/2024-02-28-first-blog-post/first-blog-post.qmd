**Dataset 1 - Analyze Boston Shootings**

Link: <https://data.boston.gov/dataset/shootings/resource/73c7e069-701f-4910-986d-b950f46c91a1?inner_span=True>

This dataset from Analyze Boston contains information about shootings in Boston, comprised of 1925 rows and 8 columns, labeled "incident_num", "shooting_date", "district", "shooting_type_v2", "victim_gender", "victim_race", "victim_ethnicity_NIBRS", and "multi_victim". The original collection of this data might have been driven by law enforcement or public safety organizations aiming to monitor and respond to shooting incidents within the city. The inclusion of details like shooting type, victim demographics, and whether an incident involved multiple victims suggests an intent to understand patterns in gun violence, the demographic distribution of victims, and potentially identify areas or populations at higher risk. Loading and cleaning the data is possible, and initial steps could involve identifying any missing values. The main questions this dataset could address might revolve around identifying trends in shootings over time, assessing the distribution of shootings across different districts, understanding the demographic profile of victims, and analyzing the relationship between the type of shooting incidents and victim demographics. Challenges in analyzing this dataset might include dealing with missing or incomplete data.
